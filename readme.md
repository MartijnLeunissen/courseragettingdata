## Getting and Cleaning Data - Readme

This is my entry for the Peer assessment course project for "Getting and Cleaning Data" offered by coursera

The only R script included in this repository is course_project.R

Running this script will download the raw data file in the current working directory if it is not already available in the workin directory. 
Subsequently it will unzip the archive, read & clean the data and write out a tidy data set out to tidy.txt

The codebook describing the tidy data set is available as codebook.md
