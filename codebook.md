# Original Data Set Information
The following data set information is available at [a]:

The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain.

# Tidy Data Set Information

The tidy data set consists of 180 rows and 68 columns

# Column description

	[1] Subject
		The id of the subject performing the experiment ranging from 1 to 30
	[2] Activity
		Name of the activity performed by the subject
		Full list of the activities:
			WALKING
			WALKING_UPSTAIRS
			WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
			SITTING
			STANDING
			LAYING     

The remaining columns contains the average of the measured mean and standard devation values. Note that the meanFreq columns are explicitly not included in the tidy dataset, because they are a weighted average

Measurement units:
- The units used for the accelerations (total and body) are 'g's (gravity of earth -> 9.80665 m/seg2).
- The gyroscope units are rad/seg.

For a more detailed description of these columns please find the content of the features_info.txt file within the full data set, which can be retrieved at [a] below:

>	The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain >	signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low >	pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and >	gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz.

>	Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk->	XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, >	tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 
>	
>	Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, >	fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals).

# Row Description

Each row contains the measurement for one subject for one specific experiment.
Each subject (30) performed all the experiment (6) to gather a total of 180 rows of data

# Cleaning up / Tidy Data Recipe

The following steps have been followed to create the tidy data set:

1. Activity labels are obtained from activity_labels
2. Feature names are obtained from features
3. Subject, measurement and activity information for the test set is obtained from subject_test, x_test and y_test files
4. Subject, measurement and activity information for the training set is obtained from subject_training, x_training and y_training files
5. The subject, measurement and activity information is merged across the data sets
6. The column names are assigned to the merged data sets, in the case of measurements these are taken from the feature names from step 2.
7. The measurement data is filtered to only retain columns concerning the mean and standard deviation measurements
	 This is done using a filter on the feature names. Only features containing 'std(' or 'mean(' are retained.
8. The subject, filtered measurement and activity information data sets are merged
9. The data is aggregated based on subject and activity
10. The activity ids are replaced by the activity names based on step 1.
